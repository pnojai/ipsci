### Where is the backlog.
[Work Breakdown Structure](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11siAxFAxaqqPvVJ5Qvedzgi_2dRuKNJpJ_qdjGm2p10/edit#gid=999682295).

### Where are APIs.
- Keys stored in text files at ./api.
- Read text file into a variable.

### Where are the data.
- Stored at ./data.
- Large datasets are not tracked in GitHub. They're listed in .gitignore and need to be downloaded by each developer.

### Patent data retrieval
#### USPTO
The USPTO API leaves questions unanswered. We want to retrieve one application, but this API is designed for returning a range of applications.

- [USPTO bulk download API](https://developer.uspto.gov/ibd-api-docs/)
- Translation and search: `nasa_patents$Application_SN` to USPTO Application *
  - Strip punction.
  - Prepend "US".
  - Ex. 13/033,085 --> US13033085

#### Google Patents
We were able to get a complete HTML file for each patent from Google Patents.

### How do you get HTML data.

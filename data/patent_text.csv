Absolute values for the patient's pressure-volume index (PVI) and the steady state ICP can then be determined by inducing two known changes in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid while recording the corresponding changes in ICP by means of the calibrated measuring device. The two pairs of data for pressure change and volume change are entered into an equation developed from an equation describing the relationship between ICP and cerebrospinal fluid volume. PVI and steady state ICP are then determined by solving the equation. Methods for inducing known changes in cerebrospinal fluid volume are described.

The principal mechanisms by which periodontal disease causes tooth loss are erosion of the periodontal ligament which holds each tooth into its socket and then erosion of the actual bone of the socket so that the tooth gradually loses its supporting structure. The disease typically proceeds from an increased concentration of bacteria in the normal sulcus (pocket) formed where the gingival epithelium folds downward along the tooth face at the abutment point. The sulcus is normally quite shallow and 1-2 mm of depth is not cause for concern. Periodontal disease can be quite localized and is not painful in the early stages.

"US5977773A","Non-intrusive impedance-based cable tester","A computer implemented physical signal analysis method is invented. This method includes two essential steps and the associated presentation techniques of the results. All the steps exist only in a computer: there are no analytic expressions resulting from the method. The first step is a computer implemented Empirical Mode Decomposition to extract a collection of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) from nonlinear, nonstationary physical signals. The decomposition is based on the direct extraction of the energy associated with various intrinsic time scales in the physical signal. Expressed in the IMF's, they have well-behaved Hilbert Transforms from which instantaneous frequencies can be calculated. The second step is the Hilbert Transform. The final result is the Hilbert Spectrum. Thus, the invention can localize any event on the time as well as the frequency axis. The decomposition can also be viewed as an expansion of the data in terms of the IMF's. Then, these IMF's, based on and derived from the data, can serve as the basis of that expansion. The local energy and the instantaneous frequency derived from the IMF's through the Hilbert transform give a full energy-frequency-time distribution of the data which is designated as the Hilbert Spectrum.

The DSCs are located throughout the orbiter, often in difficult to access locations in the vehicle fuselage. When troubleshooting a potential instrumentation problem, personnel frequently have to demate cables to verify that the cables are not the source of the problem. However, once a cable is demated, all DSCs and other systems which have a wire passing through the cable's connector have to be retested after the cable is reconnected. Due to their inaccessibility, the DSCs sometimes have to be removed in order to check them. This results in many man hours of revalidation testing on systems that were unrelated to the original problem. The cost to the Shuttle program for these retesting procedures is exorbitant. A system which allows cable continuity to be checked non-intrusively without demating the cables would therefore save many hours of testing and substantially reduce testing costs.","29","19","1997-08-15"

A reliable nondestructive test will accurately identify items with defects that render them unfit for use. At the same time, testing increase the confidence in items shown to be free of defects. Well-known items of concern are aircraft, power plant components, or bridges. Hidden defects from causes such as corrosion, production error, or wear could produce a catastrophic failure during use. Because materials, structural defects, and modes of failure vary widely, engineers use different forms of testing to the circumstances. For example, although microwave radiation can reveal cracks in reinforced plastics, it is unable to penetrate metals. Magnetic eddy currents will penetrate thin layers of metals, while gamma ray radiography will show the internal geometry of thicker metals. Accordingly, no single method of nondestructive evaluation will apply to all applications and defects.","59","25","1997-03-04"

The photonic bandgap delay apparatus also preferably has a photonic band edge transmission resonance bandwidth which is at least as wide as the bandwidth of the photonic signal such that a uniform delay is imparted over the entire bandwidth of the photonic signal. The microresonator also includes a microresonator cavity, typically defined by a pair of switchable mirrors, within which the photonic bandgap delay apparatus is disposed. By requiring the photonic signal to oscillate within the microresonator cavity so as to pass through the photonic bandgap delay apparatus several times, the microresonator can controllably impart an adjustable delay to the photonic signal.
  ","The present invention relates generally to plant chlorophyll content meters and in particular the present invention relates to a device which measures chlorophyll content in a plant using light reflectance.","Different approaches to plant stress detection by measuring leaf chlorophyll are available. One such technique which can be used is fluorescence. In the case of fluorescence, incident light is absorbed by leaf pigments. Not all of the absorbed light energy is transferred chemically to be used in photosynthesis. Rather, some of this absorbed energy is re-emitted, or fluoresced, by chlorophyll at far-red, or near-infrared wavelengths. Maximum chlorophyll fluorescence occurs at wavelengths near 690 and 730 nm. For this reason, fluorometers often measure fluorescence with narrow bands centered near 690 or 730 nm. In general, fluorescence in these bands tends to increase with decreased chlorophyll content or increased degree of physiological stress. To measure far-red or near-infrared fluorescence, the leaf is irradiated only with light of much shorter wavelengths (e.g., blue or green light). This insures that any far-red or near-infrared light emanating from the leaf is indeed fluorescence and not merely incident light that has been reflected by the leaf.","9","17","1998-01-06"

(M. W. Kehoe, âA Historical Overview of Flight Flutter Testing,â NASA-TM-4720, October 1995.) A real-time method to estimate the damping levels was developed based on a recursive prediction-error method. (R. Walker and N. Gupta, âReal-Time FLutter Analysis,â NASA-CR-170412, March 1984.) This method was extended to improve the estimates by considering an extended Kalman filter in the formulation. (R. Roy and R. Walker, âReal-Time Flutter Identification,â NASA-CR-3933, October 1985.) On-line methods using both time-domain and frequency domain characteristics of turbulence response data have also been formulated to estimate dampings. (C. L. Ruhlin et al., âEvaluation of Four Subcritical Response for On-Line Prediction of Flutter Onset in Wind Tunnel Tests,â Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 20, No. 10, October 1983, pp. 835-840.) These methods monitored stability at test points, but they were of limited usefulness for predicting the onset of aeroelastic flutter because damping may be highly nonlinear as flight conditions vary, so damping trends may indicate stability despite proximity to an explosive flutter condition. An alternative eigenspace method was formulated based on orthogonality between eigenvectors, but this method uses a parameter that, similar to damping, indicates stability and may vary nonlinearly with flight condition.

In one embodiment, the refrigeration system includes a photovoltaic panel, a variable speed compressor, an insulated enclosure, and a thermal reservoir. The photo voltaic (PV) panel converts sunlight into DC (direct current) electrical power. The DC electrical power drives a compressor that circulates refrigerant through a vapor compression refrigeration loop to extract heat from the insulated enclosure. The thermal reservoir is situated inside the insulated enclosure and includes a phase change material. As heat is extracted from the insulated enclosure, the phase change material is frozen, and thereafter is able to act as a heat sink to maintain the temperature of the insulated enclosure in the absence of sunlight.

"US6376830B1","System and method for measuring the transfer function of a guided wave device","A computer implemented physical signal analysis method includes four basic steps and the associated presentation techniques of the results. The first step is a computer implemented Empirical Mode Decomposition that extracts a collection of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) from nonlinear, nonstationary physical signals. The decomposition is based on the direct extraction of the energy associated with various intrinsic time scales in the physical signal. Expressed in the IMF's, they have well-behaved Hilbert Transforms from which instantaneous frequencies can be calculated. The second step is the Hilbert Transform which produces a Hilbert Spectrum. Thus, the invention can localize any event on the time as well as the frequency axis. The decomposition can also be viewed as an expansion of the data in terms of the IMF's. Then, these IMF's, based on and derived from the data, can serve as the basis of that expansion. The local energy and the instantaneous frequency derived from the IMF's through the Hilbert transform give a full energy-frequency-time distribution of the data which is designated as the Hilbert Spectrum. The third step filters the physical signal by combining a subset of the IMFs. In the fourth step, a curve may be fitted to the filtered signal which may not have been possible with the original, unfiltered signal.

"US6459822B1","Video image stabilization and registration","A solar powered vapor compression refrigeration system is made practicable with thermal storage and novel control techniques. In one embodiment, the refrigeration system includes a photovoltaic panel, a variable speed compressor, an insulated enclosure, and a thermal reservoir. The photovoltaic (PV) panel converts sunlight into DC (direct current) electrical power. The DC electrical power drives a compressor that circulates refrigerant through a vapor compression refrigeration loop to extract heat from the insulated enclosure. The thermal reservoir is situated inside the insulated enclosure and includes a phase change material. As heat is extracted from the insulated enclosure, the phase change material is frozen, and thereafter is able to act as a heat sink to maintain the temperature of the insulated enclosure in the absence of sunlight. The conversion of solar power into stored thermal energy is optimized by a compressor control method that effectively maximizes the compressor's usage of available energy. A capacitor is provided to smooth the power voltage and to provide additional current during compressor start-up. A controller monitors the rate of change of the smoothed power voltage to determine if the compressor is operating below or above the available power maximum, and adjusts the compressor speed accordingly. In this manner, the compressor operation is adjusted to convert substantially all available solar power into stored thermal energy.

The decomposition is based on the direct extraction of the energy associated with various intrinsic time scales in the physical signal. Expressed in the IMF's, they have well-behaved Hilbert Transforms from which instantaneous frequencies can be calculated. The second step is the Hilbert Transform.

A computer simulation is provided that can be used to predict the resulting temperature profile produced in the prostatic tissue. By changing the various control features of the catheter and method of applying microwave energy a temperature profile can be predicted and produced that is similar to the temperature profile desired for the particular patient.

The microcapsules are formed by interfacial coacervation under conditions where the shear forces are limited to 0-100 dynes/cm2 at the interface. By placing the microcapsules in a high osmotic dewatering solution, the protein solution is gradually made saturated and then supersaturated, and the controlled nucleation and crystallization of the protein is achieved.

The first step is a computer implemented Empirical Mode Decomposition that extracts a collection of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) from nonlinear, nonstationary physical signals. The decomposition is based on the direct extraction of the energy associated with various intrinsic time scales in the physical signal. Expressed in the IMF's, they have well-behaved Hilbert Transforms from which instantaneous frequencies can be calculated. The second step is the Hilbert Transform which produces a Hilbert Spectrum. Thus, the invention can localize any event on the time as well as the frequency axis. The decomposition can also be viewed as an expansion of the data in terms of the IMF's. Then, these IMF's, based on and derived from the data, can serve as the basis of that expansion. The local energy and the instantaneous frequency derived from the IMF's through the Hilbert transform give a full energy-frequency-time distribution of the data which is designated as the Hilbert Spectrum. The third step filters the physical signal by combining a subset of the IMFs. In the fourth step, a curve may be fitted to the filtered signal which may not have been possible with the original, unfiltered signal.

  ","This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60/130,475, filed Apr. 22, 1999.","The present invention relates generally to image processing, and particularly to image enhancement following JPEG image compression and decompression. Prior methods for enhancing compressed images are beset with disadvantages or limitations. To achieve acceptable compression rates, the JPEG standard adopted a lossy compression technique. Furthermore, the JPEG, MPEG, H.261 and HDITV image and video coding algorithms are severely impaired by blocking artifacts when operating at low bit rates. A compressed image becomes distorted when compressed by lossy methods. Distortion in the image can be confined to hidden areas of the image by carefully implementing the JPEG standard and several enhancement methods for reducing the distortion have been attempted. However, in some regions of the image these prior methods may further degrade the image. Prior methods for reducing distortion introduced by the JPEG compression algorithm can introduce a high-frequency artifact around high contrast edges. Algorithms for removing artifacts exist, but can mistakenly remove thin lines and smooth over important texture. Errors also arise between adjacent 8×8 pixel image blocks created by opposite-signed round-off errors in the two blocks. One way to remove these errors is to filter the image using a low-pass filter. However, other image regions that contain important high frequency information may suffer a loss in fidelity. Likewise, many other post-processing algorithms are most effective when they are selectively applied only to certain regions of an image. Previous techniques are mainly non-linear filtering methods based on local pixel statistics rather than on local frequency content. Prior efforts include; JPEG Cross Block Smoothing (CBS), Projection Onto Complex Sets (POCS), and a variety of nonlinear filters. These offer lower peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and lower subjective quality than the improved algorithms proposed in the present invention, however.

Polyaniline, however, is limited by its processability [Gregory, Richard V., Chapter 18: Solution Processing of Conductive Polymers: Fibers and Gels from Emeraldine Base Polyaniline in Handbook of Conducting Polymers, Eds. Skotheim, Terje A.; Elsenbaumer, Ronald L.; Reynolds, John R.; Marcel Dekker Inc., (1998) p. 437.]. Lignosulfonic acid-doped polyaniline (ligno-pani), however, is processable due to the grafting of polyaniline onto lignosulfonic acid, which is highly soluble in water [Viswanathan, T., “Conducting Compositions of Matter”, U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,417 (1999); and Sudhakar, M. et al. Chapter 6. Conducting Waterborne Lignosulfonic Acid-Doped Polyaniline in Semiconducting Polymers, eds. Hsieh, Bing, R.; Wei Yen; American Chemical Society, (1999) p. 76. ]. Only recently has magnetic conducting polyaniline been reported. The most common method of making magnetic polyaniline involves incorporating iron oxide crystals (such as Fe2O3 [Tang, Ben Zhong et al., Chem. Mater. (1999) 11, 1581] or Fe3O4 [Wan, M. et al., J. Polym. Sci. Part A. 1998. 36. 2799]) into the conducting material [Kambe et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,979 (1999)]. These methods, however, require use of organic solvents and the expensive process of laser pyrolysis to form the iron oxide particles. Furthermore, the Fe3O4 ferromagnetic nanoparticles incorporated in the polyaniline decompose when exposed to the strong acids used to dope the polymer. This is a major problem since most conducting polymers need to be doped with strong acids such as hydrochloric acid in order to make them conductive. Another problem is the difficulty of sythesizing complex co-polymers [Fan, J. et al., Solid State Commun. (1999) 110, 57]. Finally, pure polyaniline polymers doped with ferromagnetic material [Wan, M. et al., J. Polym. Sci. Part A.

For the GPS implementation, following downconversion to baseband, the signals would be digitized, and all subsequent processing would be digital. In the digital process, residual carriers would be removed and each signal would be correlated with a locally generated model pseudo random-noise code, all following normal GPS procedure. As part of this procedure, accumulated values would be added in software and the resulting signals would be phase-shifted in software by the amounts necessary to synthesize the desired antenna directional gain pattern of peaks and nulls. The principal advantage of this technique over the conventional radio-frequency-combining technique is that the parallel digital baseband processing of the signals from the various antenna elements would be a relatively inexpensive and flexible means for exploiting the inherent multiple-peak/multiple-null aiming capability of a phased-array antenna. In the original intended GPS application, the peaks and nulls could be directed independently for each GPS signal being tracked by the GPS receiver.

The process first pre-emphasizes the frequency components of the input sound signal which contain the consonant information in human speech. Next, a signal-to-noise ratio is determined and a spectral subtraction proportion adjusted appropriately. After spectral subtraction, low amplitude signals can be squelched. A single microphone is used to obtain both the noise-corrupted speech and the average noise estimate. This is done by determining if the frame of data being sampled is a voiced or unvoiced frame. During unvoiced frames an estimate of the noise is obtained. A running average of the noise is used to approximate the expected value of the noise. Spectral subtraction may be performed on a composite noise-corrupted signal, or upon individual sub-bands of the noise-corrupted signal. Pre-averaging of the input signal's magnitude spectrum over multiple time frames may be performed to reduce musical noise.

The capture of the spacecraft includes the steps of optically seeking and ranging the satellite using LIDAR; and matching tumble rates, rendezvousing and berthing with the satellite. Servicing of the spacecraft may be done using supervised autonomy, which is allowing a robot to execute a sequence of instructions without intervention from a remote human-occupied location. These instructions may be packaged at the remote station in a script and uplinked to the robot for execution upon remote command giving authority to proceed. Alternately, the instructions may be generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) logic onboard the robot.

Five embodiments of plant designs for liquid hydrogen production are presented. The embodiments combine hydrogen production and liquefaction into a single process to produce liquid hydrogen directly via methane containing gases; thus, eliminating the conventional technology of pressure swing adsorption process for gas mixture separation. The innovative process can be applied to produce high purity liquid hydrogen with no carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere; and can also co-produce highly pure solid carbon and liquid carbon dioxide as by-products for industrial application. The invention has provided advantages over conventional approaches that result in up to approximately 85% of first low efficiencies and approximately 56% of second law efficiency, up to approximately 100% of hydrogen and methane recovery, and a very high purity of liquid hydrogen (99.9999%).
  ","The invention described herein was made by employees of the United States Government and may be used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The objective of a centrifugal compressor is to collect a steadily flowing stream of gas, pressurize the stream, and provide a steady pressurized stream to a subsequent process or device used in turbine engines and industrial processes. Instability can develop within the fluid being processed by a centrifugal compressor that interrupts the steady flow of fluid through the compressor. The instability can range in magnitude from weak to severe. Instabilities are commonly referred to as rotating stall and surge, or simply stall and surge conditions, where rotating stall is generally at the weak end of the scale and surge describes the severe condition. In a surging condition, flow direction through the centrifugal compressor can oscillate rapidly between the forward and reverse. Local oscillations of pressure disadvantageously occur within the compressor and adjacent components. Time-averaged supplies of pressure and flow to downstream processes are undesirably diminished. More particularly, catastrophic damage to the centrifugal compressor and adjacent components can result from pressure and flow oscillations. Further, downstream processes are disrupted with potentially serious consequences. In the case of a turbine engine, the production of thrust or shaft-horsepower is severely reduced or stopped altogether.","22","25","2004-05-25"

As shown in FIG. 1, LH2 production begins with the well-known Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) process, in which a gas mixture containing carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), water and methane residues are mixed together with hydrogen in a Steam Methane Reformer to produce hydrogen (H2) rich gas. The hydrogen (H2) rich gas mixture is then separated through several pairs of adsorption columns in a purification process called Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA). About 85% of the hydrogen produced is then liquefied into LH2, with purity ranging from 99.90 to 99.99%.

These tetracarboxylic acids and dianhydrides were prepared by cross-coupling isomers of dimethylphenylboronic acid and o-xylene derivatives via Suzuki coupling with various catalysts to form 2,3,3′,4′-tetramethylbiphenyl and 2,3,3′,4′-tetramethylbenzophenone. The asymmetrical tetramethylbiphenyl and the tetramethylbenzophenone were oxidized to the corresponding tetracarboxylic acids which were then converted to asymmetrical 2,3,3′,4′-biphenyl dianhydride and 2,3,3′,4′-benzophenone dianhydride. In addition, the benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid can be reduced by hydrazine hydrate to 3,4′-methylene diphthalic tetracarboxylic acid which is converted to the corresponding 3,4′-methylenediphthalic anhydride. The unique feature of this invention is that it allows for the production of a series of asymmetric dianhydrides, not only a-BPDA, but also a-BTDA, a-MDPA and a-6FDA. This capability of producing a-BPDA, a-BTDA, a-MDPA and a-6-FDA, will usher in innovation for the preparation of high Tg, low-melt viscosities and colorless polyimides with interesting and novel properties for aerospace and electronic applications.","4","4","2004-07-23"

These tetracarboxylic acids and corresponding dianhydrides were prepared by cross-coupling of two asymmetrical-substituted o-xylenes or corresponding derivatives (Suzuki coupling) with various catalysts to form tetracarboxylic acids and the corresponding 2,3,3′,4′-tetramethylbiphenyl and 2,3,3′,4′-tetramethylbenzophenone. The asymmetrical tetramethylbiphenyl and the tetramethylbenzophenone were oxidized to obtain the corresponding tetracarboxylic acids which were then converted to 2,3,3′,4′-a-biphenyl dianhydride and 2,3,3′,4′-a-benzophenone dianhydride. In addition, the benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid can be reduced by hydrzine hydrate to 3,4′-methylene diphthalic tetracarboxylic acids which is converted to the corresponding 3,4′-methylenediphthalic anhydride.

In the body certain muscle groups, along with their associated blood vessels and nerve tissue, are covered by fascia, a noncompliant collagenous membrane, forming what is termed a “compartment.” With bleeding and swelling, compartment pressure (CP) within the compartment increases, causing a decrease in venous, capillary and arterial blood flows. The network of blood vessels in the compartment becomes compressed by the pressure differential between the CP (exterior to the blood vessel) and the blood vessel interior, this impedes the rate of blood volume flow (RBFV) through the blood vessel network. Swelling occurs within the tissue, further restricting the blood flow. Although, according to the well-known Windkessel Theory, an occasional fluctuation in blood pressure pushes a bolus of blood through the blood vessel network, this normally is insufficient to reverse the continual deterioration of the muscle mass or maintain tissue viability. As the RBFV decreases to zero and as CP rises, muscles tend to tighten, contract and deteriorate, with both nerve and muscle cells eventually dying from the lack of nutrients. Compartment Syndrome creates acute pain and a progressive loss of muscle and nerve functions, usually in the lower leg and forearm, or possibly other body areas such as the wrist, buttocks, thigh and upper arm. As pressures build, blood flow becomes blocked, leading to permanent injury (Volkmann's Contracture) and possible amputation of the limb.","2","26","2004-03-22"

  ","This invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract, and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 U.S.C. § 202) in which the Contractor has elected not to retain title.","The performance of the photodetector is limited by the efficiency with which the photocathode emits electrons in response to incoming photons. The photocathode is generally a planar semiconductor crystal. Each incident photon creates a hole-electron pair in the semiconductor crystal by elevating an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving a hole in the valence band. Generally, a semiconductor material having a bandgap energy corresponding to the infrared region (such as GaAs) does not readily emit electrons from its surface when struck by photons, due to an energy barrier that arises at the crystal surface of the semiconductor. In order for surface emission to occur, the electron must overcome both the work function of the surface and the band gap energy of the semiconductor. Conventionally, this problem is overcome by “activating” the surface of the photocathode in such a manner that this energy barrier is overcome. In the case of a UV or IR photodetector, the photocathode can be a group III semiconductor or group III-V compound semiconductor, and the “activation” consists of depositing a thin Cesium (Cs) coating on the crystal surface. The Fermi levels in the Cs and semiconductor layers equilibrate at the interface between the layers, forcing the valence and conduction band structures in the semiconductor layer to “bend” so much that the conduction band at the surface is below the Fermi level and the bulk conduction band bottom lies above the vacuum level at the surface. This condition is favorable for electron emission from the photocathode surface because electrons excited in the bulk can diffuse toward the surface where they can tunnel or be ballistically emitted from the crystal into the vacuum.","3","7","2005-02-09"

Urine, or a contaminated liquid similar to and/or containing urine and thus having a relatively high salt and urea content is passed through an activated carbon filter to provide a resulting liquid, to remove most of the organic molecules. The resulting liquid is passed through a semipermeable membrane from a membrane first side to a membrane second side, where a fortified drink having a lower water concentration (higher osmotic potential) than the resulting liquid is positioned.

Erzberger and T. Pecsvaradi (“4D Guidance System Design With Application To STOL Air Traffic Control”, 13th Joint Automatic Control Confer., Stanford, Calif. Aug. 16-18, 1972, pp. 445-442) and has been considered by many other workers since then. One potential problem with use of (flight) time as a fourth coordinate is that an along-track error couples into aircraft altitude. In this approach, when an elapsed time specified by flight plan coordinates is reached or exceeded, an aircraft may be required to land many miles short of, or many miles beyond, its destination. Alternatively, failure of an air traffic management (ATM) ground computer could abruptly deposit responsibility for safe separation of aircraft proceeding along the same general route onto human air traffic controllers (ATCs). One ultimate goal of an automated ATM system is to remove, or minimize reliance on, ATCs from active participation in maintenance of separation between aircraft.","40","43","2005-09-22"

Nafion is a relatively expensive perfluorinated polymer which has an operating temperature in a fuel cell at approximately 80° C. Above 80° C., however, the membrane loses its effectiveness due to a loss of proton conductivity. The Nafion® membrane technology is well known in the art and is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,282,875 and 4,330,654. Unreinforced Nafion® membranes are used almost exclusively as the ion-exchange membrane in solid polymer electrolyte-fuel cell (SPEFC) applications. The membrane is fabricated from a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and perfluorovinyl ethersulfonyl fluoride. There are many advantages in operating a PEM fuel cell above 100° C. The advantages obtained when a PEM fuel cell is operated above 100° C. is that the rate of the reaction inside the fuel cell is increased, the catalyst is less susceptible to poisoning by carbon monoxide and the power density of the fuel cell is increased by the reduction of ancillary equipment such as humidifiers and compressors. There are many systems currently being investigated to replace Nafion for use in PEM fuel cells (J. Power Sources, 5044, 1-22, 2002). The most promising of these are the acid-doped polybenzimidazoles (Electrochimica Acta 43, 1289-1294, 1998), sulfonated polyetherketone (Solid State Ionics, 97, 1-15, 1997), and the sulfonated naphthalenic polyimides.

Taxi instructions, at towered, control airports, are verbally issued by ground control using radio-telephony to the aircraft. When an aircraft taxies across the airport, it travels on a series of assigned taxiways based on directions received from a ground controller. Ground controllers at busy airports may be directing the movement of several dozen aircraft at any particular time. A taxiing aircraft will often have to travel across active runways to reach its destination; therefore, it is critical to coordinate surface operations with takeoff/landing instructions to prevent runway incursions.

In these methods, a coating material, such as a metal in the form of powder is fed into a flame. The flame melts the metal powder, so that it can be deposited onto a surface as a coating. An important measurement of quality in most thermal spraying methods is the adhesion of the coating on the surface. A higher velocity thermal spray is generally preferred as the impingement of the coating material onto the deposition surface at higher velocity, typically results in coatings which exhibit better adhesion to the deposition surface. An additional concern common to most methods of thermal spraying is to avoid overheating the coating material which can lead to vaporization or oxidation and reduce the overall quality of the coating produced. In addition, it is also desirable to produce small droplets of material to ensure even coating and maximize surface to volume ratios in order to enhance adhesion and quality of the coating produced.","0","39","2007-09-28"

Compared to metals that range from 200 W/m-K to 15 W/m-K and ceramic borosilicate glass that is around 1 W/m-K, plastics are good heat insulators. On the other hand, compared to cellular solids such as polyurethane and polystyrene foams which have thermal conductivity values around 0.025 W/m-K, plastics are remarkable heat conductors. Therefore on a material basis, it can be concluded that plastics are neither terrific conductors of heat nor great heat insulators. Similarly in the case of mechanical strength, structural plastic materials fall between metals and foams in strength and modulus. There is a significant advantage to be gained in the thermoplastics industry if plastics could be easily made into better heat insulators since in many applications heat flow is not desired and the mechanical properties of cellular solids are not acceptable. Polymers also typically do not perform well at low temperatures or under cryogenic conditions due to their brittleness at these temperatures. Therefore, metals are usually used instead of plastics in cryogenic conditions due to their better performance at low temperatures. Since polymers are much lighter in weight compared to metals, as well as being easier to process, improving thermal performance properties of plastics would be economically and industrially preferred for such applications.

To activate and control each acoustic source, a pulsed signal is applied thereto. An infrared imager focused on the surface region detects a thermal image of the surface region. A data capture device records the thermal image in synchronicity with each pulse of the pulsed signal such that a time series of thermal images is generated.

Nematic liquid crystalline polymer phases have the advantage that they show shear-thinning effects, which makes them very easy to process via a variety of melt processing techniques, and complex parts can be made with virtually no mold shrinkage. Additional advantages of liquid crystalline polymers over classic polymers include improved barrier properties towards small molecules (e.g., H2, O2, H2O, etc.).","0","13","2007-11-05"

  ","Work related to this invention was performed under a joint research agreement between the National Aeronautics and Space administration and the University of California.","Chemical sensors have been developed for decades to detect various concentration levels of gases and vapors for deployment in a wide range of applications in industry, space mission, environment monitoring, medical, military, and others. The detection usually centers on change in a particular property or status of the sensing material (such as thermal, electrical, optical, mechanical, etc) upon exposure to the species of interest. The sensing material may be any of several elements from the periodic table, plus inorganic, semiconducting and organic compounds, in bulk or thin film form. One of the most investigated classes of chemical sensors in the past is the high-temperature metal oxide sensors due to these sensors' high sensitivity at low ppm to ppb concentration levels, with tin oxide thin films as an example. Polymer sensors have been studied in recent years because they can be operated at room temperature with low power consumption and are easily fabricated. Although commercial sensors based on these materials are available, continued research is in progress with sensing technologies using new sensing materials and new transducer platforms. New sensing technologies, such as nanotechnology-based sensors, are being developed to overcome the large power consumption and poor selectivity of metal oxides sensors, and to improve the poor sensitivity and narrow detection spectrum of polymer sensors.","4","9","2007-03-07"

"US8067478B1","Process for preparing polymer reinforced silica aerogels","An electromagnetic braking system and method is provided for selectively braking a motor using an electromagnetic brake having an electromagnet, a permanent magnet, a rotor assembly, and a brake pad. The brake assembly applies when the electromagnet is de-energized and releases when the electromagnet is energized. When applied the permanent magnet moves the brake pad into frictional engagement with a housing, and when released the electromagnet cancels the flux of the permanent magnet to allow a leaf spring to move the brake pad away from the housing. A controller has a DC/DC converter for converting a main bus voltage to a lower braking voltage based on certain parameters. The converter utilizes pulse-width modulation (PWM) to regulate the braking voltage. A calibrated gap is defined between the brake pad and permanent magnet when the brake assembly is released, and may be dynamically modified via the controller.

Subsequent exposure of the gel to heat, light, catalyst or any other method of promoting polymerization causes polymer crosslinking without the need for any additional infiltration steps thereby significantly shortening the process. Another advantage is that the resulting aerogel monolith is more uniform, since the addition of a polymer crosslinker is not limited by diffusion. Moreover, where complete polymerization requires a balanced stoichiometry, this requirement is more easily met by this one-pot process. The primary requirement of the one-pot reaction process is that the polymer crosslinking agent does not interfere with gellation of the silica. This means that the precursor molecules are present in the sol, but are substantially inert until conditions are met for polymerization or they partially react with the forming gel at low enough concentration to allow gellation to take place. For example, polyamic acid oligomers capped with aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTES) combined in solvent with tetramethoxysilane, water and amine catalyst gels in less than an hour. Subsequently, heating the gels at temperatures ranging up to about 200° C. causes imidization to talke place. Supercritical drying of the gel yields a strong, polyimide crosslinked aerogel monolith. In another example, trimethoxysilypropyl acrylate coreacts with tetramethoxy silane (TMOS) and water, either in the presence of additional acrylate molecules in the sol or by itself. The gel is then exposed to heat in the presence of an initiator or U.V. light, which causes acrylate polymerization. Supercritical drying of the gel produces a strong acrylate-crosslinked aerogel monolith. A flexible polymer crosslinked aerogel can be produced in the same way by introducing flexible linking groups as alternate flexible polymer precursors in the sol and keeping the silane concentration relatively low.","12","22","2006-10-19"

In addition, the benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid can be reduced by hydrazine hydrate to 3,4′-methylene diphthalic tetracarboxylic acid which is converted to the corresponding 3,4′-methylenediphthalic anhydride. The unique feature of this invention is that it allows for the production of a series of asymmetric dianhydrides, not only a-BPDA, but also a-BTDA, a-MDPA and a-6FDA. This capability of producing a-BPDA, a-BTDA, a-MDPA and a-6-FDA, will provide innovation for the preparation of high Tg, low-melt viscosities and colorless polyimides with interesting and novel properties for aerospace and electronic applications.","4","7","2006-03-18"

For example, 30% of commercial aviation and 50% of all aviation fatalities are categorized as controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) accidents. In general aviation (GA), almost three times more GA fatalities occurred in instrument meteorological (i.e., limited visibility) conditions. Limited visibility also increases the potential for runway incursions. From 2000 to 2003, 5.6 runway incursions occurred on average per million aircraft operations or 1,474 runway incursions out of 262 million aircraft operations. Probably the most significant problem causing airport delays are limited runway capacity and the increased air traffic separation required when weather conditions fall below visual flight rules operations. Many of these visibility problems have much to do with how cognitively complex flying has become owing, largely to the evolution of cockpit displays design, which require the pilot to extract and integrate information from multiple display sources to form a mental model.

The hot sections of these engines are exposed to gas temperatures in excess of 1500° C. Temperature gradients from the turbine blade tip to the root of the blade can be as large as 450° C. Thus, strain measurement under these conditions using resistance strain gages can lead to considerable error due to apparent strain effects, including thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the gage and substrate as well as the temperature coefficient of resistance or TCR. Therefore, apparent strain effects are particularly troublesome when the active strain gage elements have an inherently large temperature coefficient of resistance. Apparent strain effects in resistance strain gages can be mitigated by employing strain gages that have a similar thermal expansion to the substrate and a smaller temperature coefficient of resistance, but the choices are much more limited when going to higher temperatures, since the piezoreisistive response and chemical and electrical stability become more important under these conditions. However, given that the materials comprising high temperature strain gage element such as indium tin oxide (ITO), have an inherently large temperature coefficient of resistance (See FIG. 1), the choices for temperature compensation are limited to placing reisistors or other gage elements in series with the active strain element as taught by O.

The gravity is lower than the gravity on Earth. More specifically, atmospheric density near the Martian surface is roughly equivalent to an altitude of 100,000 feet on Earth. The low atmospheric density leads to a high cruise velocity, but a low Reynolds number. Since the speed of sound on Mars is lower than on Earth, transonic aerodynamic effects are encountered at a lower flight speed. Low atmospheric density also presents difficulty in generating sufficient thrust. Therefore, with such a thin atmosphere, generating enough lift to support airplane weight is difficult and wing loading must be small.","1","15","2010-03-11"

"US8489181B1","Heart electrical actions as biometric indicia","A robotic system includes a tendon-driven finger and a control system. The system controls the finger via a force-based control law when a tension sensor is available, and via a position-based control law when a sensor is not available. Multiple tendons may each have a corresponding sensor. The system selectively injects a compliance value into the position-based control law when only some sensors are available. A control system includes a host machine and a non-transitory computer-readable medium having a control process, which is executed by the host machine to control the finger via the force- or position-based control law. A method for controlling the finger includes determining the availability of a tension sensor(s), and selectively controlling the finger, using the control system, via the force or position-based control law. The position control law allows the control system to resist disturbances while nominally maintaining the initial state of internal tendon tensions.

Approximately a dozen different biometric indicia have been proposed, but implementation methods for some of these approaches have not been disclosed. Many of these biometric indicia are associated with inherent physiological characteristics of the user's body. Another set of such indicia relate to what may be characterized as neuro-physiological (“N-P”) characteristics that partly reflect a learning or behavioral process and do not rely exclusively on purely physiological features. Use of one or more of these N-P characteristics as a biometric indicium has received relatively little attention, in part because of the perceived difficulty of implementing a procedure to measure such a characteristic. An example is a sequence of bioelectric signals associated with cycles of the heart.","2","4","2009-01-02"

Flash systems emit a single flash of light, which covers an entire target area, eliminating the need for scanning mirrors and a repeatedly pulsed laser. Flash systems typically utilize a photo-detector array so that different parts of the array correspond to different locations in the target area. Because these systems only create range data, they are often connected to global positioning systems to provide location information of the target area.","0","2","2010-09-01"

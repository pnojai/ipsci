     For an inflatable structure having a flexible outer shell or wall structure having a flexible restraint layer comprising interwoven, load-bearing straps, apparatus for integrating one or more substantially rigid members into the flexible shell. For each rigid member, a corresponding opening is formed through the flexible shell for receiving the rigid member. A plurality of connection devices are mounted on the rigid member for receiving respective ones of the load-bearing straps. In one embodiment, the connection devices comprise inner connecting mechanisms and outer connecting mechanisms, the inner and outer connecting mechanisms being mounted on the substantially rigid structure and spaced along a peripheral edge portion of the structure in an interleafed array in which respective outer connecting mechanisms are interposed between adjacent pairs of inner connecting mechanisms, the outer connecting mechanisms projecting outwardly from the peripheral edge portion of the substantially rigid structure beyond the adjacent inner connecting mechanisms to form a staggered array of connecting mechanisms extending along the panel structure edge portion. In one embodiment, the inner and outer connecting mechanisms form part of an integrated, structure rotatably mounted on the rigid member peripheral edge portion.

    <heading>ORIGIN OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="p-0002">The invention described herein was made by employees of the United States Government and may be manufactured and used by or for the government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.</p>
    
    
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="p-0003">This invention relates generally to inflatable structures having flexible outer walls and, more particularly, to apparatus and methods for integrating rigid structures, such as panels, bulkheads, window frame assemblies, hatches, and the like, into the flexible outer walls of such inflatable structures.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="p-0004">The use of inflatable structures is of interest for applications in which it is desired to provide storage facilities, habitats, laboratories, or the like in remote or isolated locations. Such an inflatable structure may be conveniently transported to a desired location or region in a reduced-volume, non-inflated mode and deployed at the site by inflating the structure, thereby increasing its volume and quickly forming a self-supporting structure. Thus, when it is desired to deploy such a structure in a remote location, or in a region subject to severe environmental conditions, for example, it is advantageous to be able to transport the structure to the desired location in a reduced-volume, non-inflated mode, and to enable its convenient deployment at the remote site. Thus, the time and difficulty entailed in its deployment at the site may be substantially reduced, thereby avoiding prolonged exposure of workers to hazardous conditions during the deployment process.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">The use of such an inflatable structure or module is also a means for providing a deployed structure of substantial size and interior volume, substantially greater than that of a conventional, rigid structure of the same mass. As noted, such inflatable structures have been proposed for use as laboratories, human habitats or storage facilities in remote or isolated areas. For example, they are considered advantageous for use as vehicles or modules intended for applications in exoatmospheric space, e.g., vehicles intended for use during orbital or extra-orbital missions, including those intended as habitats on the moon or planets. For such applications, the inflatable structures are launched and placed in orbital or other desired trajectories while in a collapsed, non-inflated mode and then inflated, thereby providing a space module having substantially larger volume than conventional modules of equivalent mass and initial size.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Conventional, non-inflatable or hard-shelled space modules, such as those forming sections of the International Space Station (ISS), have been delivered to the ISS within the cargo bay of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Shuttle. In order to minimize the difficulty of tasks required during assembly and deployment of the modules in space, such modules are fabricated and assembled before being loaded into the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle, or other suitable launch vehicle, thereby reducing the complexity of operations required of the astronauts during final assembly and adjustments of the module in space.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Because such conventional space modules have been carried within the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle, their external dimensions must be compatible with the interior dimensions of the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. Accordingly, their size and configuration have been limited by the internal dimensions and configuration of the Space Shuttle cargo bay. Although sufficient for some applications, larger modules are desirable for other applications, for which the use of inflatable modules is advantageous.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Further advantages of such inflatable modules for space applications include the fact that they are substantially lighter than conventional, “hard shell” modules of equivalent deployed size, due to the fact that such an inflatable module does not require a reinforced, outer metallic skin and associated support structures. A further advantage is the fact that although the diameter of the inflatable module, before deployment, is small, relative to that desired in the deployed vehicle, after deployment the diameter may be substantially larger than that of the outer diameter of the cargo section of the Space Shuttle, or other launch vehicles that may be used, thereby providing a deployed module having a large internal volume suitable for applications such as orbital laboratories, habitats, storage modules, etc. Publications relating to the design of such inflatable space modules include U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,974,109 and 6,938,858; United States Patent Application Publication No. US 2005/0108950 A1, published May 26, 2005, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,231,010 and 6,547,189. The construction of such space modules is disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,231,010 and 6,547,189, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Whereas such inflatable structures have utility in a variety of applications and environments, their construction entails design considerations not typically experienced in the construction of conventional buildings, storage structures, rigid space modules, and the like. This is particularly the case with respect to space applications, wherein safety considerations are paramount, and wherein human lives are dependent upon the structural integrity and reliability of such structures. For example, such design considerations include factors relating to the integration of rigid panels, bulkheads, hatches, window frame assemblies, and the like into the flexible outer walls of such modules. As disclosed in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,231,010 and 6,547,189 patents, the flexible outer walls of such inflatable space structures are complex structures incorporating multiple layers formed of materials selected to perform respective functions. For example, and starting with the innermost layer and progressing outwardly, such flexible outer wall structures may include: an inner protective liner; at least one bladder of a gas-impermeable material; a structural restraint layer; a meteoroid orbital debris (M/MOD) shield assembly, and an outer protective layer. Structural loads resulting from the inflation of the inflatable module are born by the restraint layer, which may be a webbing comprising multiple, orthogonal strips of high tensile strength material such as Kevlar® or Vectran®.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">As disclosed in the &#39;010 and &#39;189 patents previously incorporated by reference, inflatable structures or modules adapted for use in exoatmospheric space, in some applications, have been of elongated, cylindrical configuration. In such embodiments, they may include a longitudinally extending, rigid central core or truss assembly around which the flexible shell or outer wall structure is formed. Upon being inflated by the introduction of gas under pressure during deployment, the module expands, and the flexible wall structure is thus stretched outwardly into an elongated, substantially cylindrical shape, the elongated central core extending longitudinally and coaxially along the length of the inflatable structure. As also disclosed in the referenced &#39;010 and &#39;189 patents, in one embodiment, end portions of the flexible wall structure are attached to respective end portions of the longitudinal core and, when deployed, form partially hemispherical end portions. As will be understood by those in the art, when inflated, the flexible wall structure is subject to tensional forces caused by the increased interior pressure, i.e., the differential pressure between that of the interior volume of the structure and the external environment, which in the case of a vehicle in space is a substantially perfect vacuum.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Tensional forces exerted on the flexible wall structure are largely sustained by the restraint layer, which in some embodiments comprises a webbing formed of interwoven straps. After deployment, pressures within an inflated module intended for use as a human habitat are typically in the range of approximately 8 to 15 pounds per square inch. Because such space modules, in their deployed, inflated mode, may be of substantial diameter, the tensional forces on the restraint layer may also be substantial, particularly forces exerted circumferentially of cylindrical portions of such modules. As will be understood by those in the art, the longitudinal forces, i.e., the forces exerted along the longitudinal axis of the module may be partially sustained by the rigid interior core and are generally less than the circumferential forces sustained by circumferentially extending straps.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Whereas the construction of such inflatable modules has been the subject of extensive development, complications exist with respect to certain design features. As previously stated, this is particularly the case with respect to the integration of rigid elements, such as bulkheads, panels, hatches, window assemblies, and the like, into the flexible wall structure. For example, if such a module is intended for use as a work area, laboratory, or habitat, it is often desirable to provide windows, doors, or the like in the module flexible wall structure. The provision of windows is of interest with respect to inflatable modules such as laboratories, human habitats, or the like intended for use in exoatmospheric space, particularly those that will be occupied for extended periods of time. In addition to the obvious human factors, the ability to view structures external of the module may be of importance during docking maneuvers, safety inspections, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">However, the integration of mounting of a rigid structure in the flexible wall structure of such an inflatable module presents unique challenges to the designer. For example, if one or more window frame assemblies are to be integrated within such a flexible wall structure to permit visual observations through the windows, it is necessary, at each window, to form openings or “structural pass throughs” through the portions of the flexible wall structure in register with the window frame assembly. Thus, openings must be formed through the bladder, the inner and outer protective layers, and the flexible restraint layer, among others. To prevent the escape of gas under pressure from the interior of the module through such an opening, means must be provided for sealingly attaching the bladder to the periphery of the window frame. With respect to the restraint layer, each of the longitudinal and circumferential straps adjacent an opening, e.g., each of the orthogonally arrayed straps that intersect the window frame assembly must be terminated to form the opening in which the window frame assembly will be mounted. As will be discussed below, loops are preferably formed in the end portions of the straps adjacent the window frame assembly for facilitating their connection to the rigid window frame or panel, as described in the referenced &#39;189 and &#39;010 patents and as will be discussed further below.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">For ensuring the physical integrity of the module, provisions must be made for securely attaching the looped end portions of the straps to portions of the window frame such that tension occurring as the module is inflated can be retained on all the straps, including those terminated at the windows, applying tensional loads on the straps as required both for maintaining a desired configuration and configuration of the module when inflated and for maintaining its structural integrity. Additionally, it is desirable to evenly distribute such loads and to prevent binding of the straps during movement and flexure of the flexible wall structure. As disclosed in the &#39;189 and ‘610’patents, the end portions of the straps are advantageously looped around rollers rotatably supported by devises or the like mounted along the periphery of the window frames, whereby tensions on the upper and lower portions of the strap loops are substantially equalized, and whereby the straps may exert tension on the window frame from different directions without binding at their connection to the frame, and whereby tensional forces on the straps may be substantially equalized and consistently applied to the window frame.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">The use of such structural pass-through panels, such as window frames, having rollers supported by devises adjacent the peripheral edges of the panel through which end portions of respective webbing straps are looped, and wherein circumferentially extending straps are interwoven with the longitudinal straps, is disclosed, for example, in the &#39;189 patent. Also disclosed in the &#39;189 patent are means for sealingly attaching the bladder of such an inflatable module to peripheral portions of rigid panels, window frames, or the like for preventing leakage of air from the interior of an inflated module around the frame and through the opening.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Further issues of concern with respect to the integration and interaction of the rigid and flexible components include the necessity of preventing damage to flexible layers, such as the bladder, restraint layer, and protective backing materials, as the module is unfolded and expanded during its inflation and deployment. Also, both during and after deployment, differential stresses and different reaction to stresses by rigid and flexible components are of concern and could result in undesirable degrees of strain on the flexible components if not properly compensated for and distributed. For example, and as will be understood by those in the art, tensional forces exerted on the flexible straps can result in a degree of elongation or stretching of the straps, whereas the same forces exerted on a rigid panel produce substantially no deformation of the panel. Thus, and as will be more fully understood from the disclosure to follow, means must be provided for reducing potentially deleterious, differential stresses on the respective flexible straps, for ensuring that such forces are evenly distributed, and for accommodating differing reactions to stress of the rigid and flexible components.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">As will be understood from the description to follow, advantageous features of the present invention include the use of mechanisms for connecting circumferential and longitudinal webbing straps to one or more rigid panel members, such as window frames, such that tensional loads are equally distributed thereon and such that the loads on the straps are parallel to the major axes of the panel, so that bending moments on the panel and on elements mounted on the panel are reduced. As will be understood from the disclosure to follow, in preferred embodiments of the present invention, such non-axial forces are eliminated or substantially reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">Connecting mechanisms for connecting respective load bearing straps to such rigid panel structures, in some applications, have comprised attachment mechanisms affixed to the panels and mutually spaced along the edges of such panels, whereby the load-bearing straps supported by respective connecting mechanisms are maintained in mutually spaced, mutually parallel configuration. This spacing between adjacent straps has, in the past, been necessary because the connecting mechanisms, typically including clevis structures and rollers, are wider than the respective straps and are mutually spaced along the panel edge portions. As will be understood from the present disclosure, in mechanisms constructed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the mutually parallel straps connected to edge portions of such a rigid panel may be substantially contiguous to one another rather than being mutually spaced. This permits the use of a greater number of connecting means, and thus, a greater number of straps per unit of length along a given panel edge portion, thus distributing the loads through a greater numbers of straps than would be otherwise permitted and thereby reducing the loads sustained by the individual straps.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">Another complication entailed in the integration of rigid structures into the flexible outer walls of such inflatable structures relates to the fact that, as previously noted, circumferentially directioned forces sustained by the cylindrical wall portion of a module after inflation are normally greater than those sustained in the longitudinal direction. As will be understood from the disclosure to follow, complications from such an effect are substantially alleviated in embodiments of the present invention. As previously suggested, a further complication relative to such inflatable structures which is addressed herein relates to the fact that, as pressure increases within the module during deployment, the flexible straps tend to stretch and elongate as they sustain their respective tensional loads. However, there is relatively little deformation or elongation of the rigid structures. Thus, elongation of the inflatable and rigid structures can differ, creating an uneven load distribution around the panel structure. If unaddressed, this fairly local effect could overload the inflatable shell and/or frame in that region.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">With reference to the disclosure, although the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in detail herein relate primarily to applications of inflatable modules in exoatmospheric space, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to such applications and also has utility in various terrestrial and marine applications, particularly those in which it is desired to provide enclosed storage or habitat facilities at a remote location or under severe weather conditions, and in which it is desired to transport the facilities to such locations in a compact mode and to deploy them quickly and conveniently at the desired site.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">Thus, the present invention provides structure for forming an improved interface between rigid and flexible components in an inflatable structure having a flexible outer shell or wall. In particular, the present invention resolves problems relating to the mounting of rigid panels, such as window frame structures, in the flexible walls of such inflatable structures and is adapted for reliable operation for extended periods in severe environments. The design and construction of the present invention and such inflatable structures, and the nature of the forces acting upon their various components, will be more fully understood and appreciated from the detailed disclosure to follow.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="p-0043">Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawing. As previously noted, the embodiments illustrated and described in the present disclosure relate to applications of the invention in inflatable modules adapted for deployment in exoatmospheric space. It should be understood, however, that other applications and embodiments are also within the scope of the invention, which is defined by the accompanying claims. As previously noted, the construction of such inflatable space modules is disclosed in issued patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,231,010 and 6,547,189, both of which have been incorporated by reference. Accordingly, reference is made to the &#39;010 and &#39;189 patents for a detailed disclosure of the construction of such inflatable modules.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">With initial reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an inflatable module <b>10</b>, with its M/MOD shielding and other components omitted for clarity, includes a restraint layer <b>12</b>. The restraint layer <b>12</b> and module <b>10</b> are represented as they would be configured in the module&#39;s fully inflated, deployed mode. As disclosed in the &#39;010 and &#39;189 patents, the restraint layer <b>12</b> constitutes one of the layers of the flexible outer wall structure or shell, not shown, of the module <b>10</b>, the flexible outer shell being disclosed in the &#39;189 and &#39;010 patents.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">The restraint layer <b>12</b> serves to physically constrain the module <b>10</b> and prevent it from expanding outwardly beyond its design configuration. It further serves to prevent outward deformation of the bladder <b>69</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As disclosed in the &#39;189 and &#39;010 patents, the restraint layer <b>12</b> is preferably in the form of a webbing formed of interwoven, flexible, load-bearing straps orthogonally arrayed, including a plurality of circumferentially extending, load-bearing straps <b>14</b> (seen more clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>) and a plurality of longitudinal reinforcing straps <b>16</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, and <b>5</b>), interwoven with the circumferential straps <b>14</b>. As seen most clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the longitudinal straps <b>16</b> are arrayed in mutually parallel alignment. In the present embodiment, the module <b>10</b> includes an elongated, cylindrical body portion <b>17</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and the longitudinal straps <b>16</b> thus extend longitudinally of the module cylindrical body portion <b>17</b>, or generally parallel to the module longitudinal axis <b>18</b>. The circumferential straps <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>) are also arrayed in mutually parallel alignment and extend circumferentially of the module cylindrical body portion <b>17</b> as indicated at line <b>20</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As known to those in the art, such reinforcing straps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> may be of various forms appropriate to particular applications. As previously discussed, they are advantageously woven strips of high-tensile strength material such as Kevlar® or Vectran®.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">As also disclosed in the &#39;010 and &#39;189 patents and as previously discussed, in some applications, inflatable space structures such as module <b>10</b> include a rigid, central core or truss assembly, not shown, extending longitudinally and coaxially of the module cylindrical body portion <b>17</b>. The central core serves to provide structural support and longitudinal rigidity to the module <b>10</b>. End portions <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the restraint layer <b>12</b> are connected to the end portions of the central core, not shown. Longitudinal straps <b>16</b> are thus suitably connected to opposite end portions of the central core. In the present, illustrative embodiment, in its inflated mode, the module&#39;s end portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are of hemispherical configuration, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other embodiments they may be of semi-toroidal configuration. During inflation, the flexible restraint layer <b>12</b> is urged outwardly by the positive pressure within the bladder <b>69</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), which itself is constrained by the restraint layer <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, the module <b>10</b> includes first, second, and third window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b> mounted in the module flexible outer shell, portions of which are seen at <b>68</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b> are mounted in and supported by portions of the restraint layer <b>12</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and connected at their peripheral edge portions to the straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, as will be shown and described in detail hereinbelow. With respect to the first window frame assembly <b>26</b> as typical of the three window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b>, its association with and connection to straps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> may be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. As will also be more fully understood from the description to follow, the window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b> are received within respective openings, not shown, formed through the restraint layer <b>12</b>. Each of the window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> includes structure (not shown) for receiving a transparent window assembly <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0048">With respect to the first window frame assembly <b>26</b> as typical, and with primary reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, window frame assembly <b>26</b> includes a panel structure or window frame <b>38</b>, of rectangular configuration in plan. The elongated or oval window assembly <b>32</b>, in the present embodiment, is oriented such that it extends lengthwise of the rectangular window frame <b>38</b>, or along the module circumferential axis <b>20</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As known in the art, window frame assemblies adapted for use in space vehicles suitably include multiple, mutually spaced panes of transparent material such as glass or plastic material, not shown.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">The rectangular rigid panel or window frame <b>38</b> is received and supported within a corresponding rectangular opening, not shown, formed through the restraint layer <b>12</b> such that the frame is contiguous with the adjacent portions of the restraint layer. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the circumferential and longitudinal straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> that intersect the frame <b>38</b> are thus terminated adjacent the frame to form the rectangular opening in which the frame is supported, the end portions of the intersecting straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> being folded back to form loops <b>39</b>, seen more clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the respective end portions of the straps at their juncture with frame <b>38</b>. The construction and application of such looped end portions <b>39</b> for facilitating the connection of load-bearing straps, such as straps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, to rigid structures such as frame <b>38</b> is disclosed in the &#39;189 and &#39;010 patents, previously incorporated by reference, and will not be described in detail herein. The opening formed through the restraint layer <b>12</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) thus corresponds substantially in configuration to the external configuration of the window frame assembly <b>38</b>. Additionally, the window frame <b>38</b>, in side elevation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), corresponds with and continues the semi-cylindrical configuration of the cylindrical restraint layer body portion <b>17</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), for reasons that will become apparent from the description to follow. Thus, the panel structure or window frame <b>38</b> is contiguous with those straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> that intersect the frame, and loops <b>39</b> are formed in the end portions of the intersecting straps adjacent the frame for facilitating the connection of the straps to the frame, as described more fully below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-18</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">The construction of the window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and their integration into the restraint layer <b>12</b> will now be described in greater detail. Whereas, for illustrative purposes, the present embodiment has three rigid structures (three window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>30</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), it should be understood that in other embodiments a greater or lesser number of such rigid structures may be employed. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, the window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are not aligned with one another along either the longitudinal or circumferential axes <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. More specifically, they are positioned in a mutually offset array such that none of them is in longitudinal or circumferential alignment with another. Thus, none of the circumferential and longitudinal straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the restraint layer <b>12</b> intersect more than one of the window frame assemblies. Such an arrangement avoids the requirement of making multiple, successive breaks in the straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, particularly larger modules, they may be longitudinally and/or circumferentially aligned.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">First window frame assembly <b>26</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, substantially identical to the other window frame assemblies <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, will be described herein as typical and representative of the other two. With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in which straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are omitted for clarity, rigid, rectangular panel structure or window frame <b>38</b> of window frame assembly <b>26</b> has first and second end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and first and second side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. As viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the first and second end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> form the upper and lower edge portions of the window frame <b>38</b>, and the first and second side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> form the left and right edge portions, respectively, of the window frame <b>38</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">In the present embodiment, window seat <b>48</b>, of oval configuration, extends lengthwise of the window frame assembly <b>26</b>. As previously noted, windows such as windows <b>32</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) employed in space vehicles typically comprise multiple window panes for safety and for minimizing fogging of the window panes. The construction of such multi-pane windows is known in the art and will not be described in detail herein. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 4</figref> and with primary reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rectangular window frame <b>38</b> is curved along its length in a semi-cylindrical configuration such that its outer surface <b>49</b> <i>a </i>is convexly. The first and second end portions <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> of the frame <b>39</b> extend linearly, parallel to the longitudinal straps <b>16</b> and the longitudinal axis <b>18</b>. Thus, the contour of the window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is substantially identical to that of the of the restraint layer <b>12</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) when the module <b>10</b> is fully deployed, thereby continuing the restraint layer&#39;s internal contour along both the circumferential and longitudinal axes and permitting the window frame assemblies to nest within and mate with corresponding openings formed through the restraint layer <b>12</b>. As will be more fully understood from the discussion below, the semi-cylindrical configuration of the window frame assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> reduces differential and torsional loads on the window frame assemblies.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the oval window seat <b>48</b> is of rectangular configuration as viewed laterally. As previously noted, the circumferential straps <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>) extend circumferentially around the module body portion <b>17</b>, as diagrammatically represented at line <b>20</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More specifically, those circumferential straps <b>14</b> that intersect one of the window frames <b>38</b>, <b>28</b>, or <b>30</b> terminate at the first and second end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the respective frame.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a plurality of connecting means <b>50</b> are mounted on the window frame <b>38</b> for receiving respective ones of the load-bearing straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>) and connecting them to the frame <b>38</b>. The connecting means <b>50</b> mounted on end portions <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> of frame <b>38</b> form a staggered array <b>60</b> of connecting mechanisms, as will be more fully described in the sections to follow. With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in which straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are also omitted for clarity, and with respect to the staggered array <b>60</b> of connecting means <b>50</b> mounted on frame end portions <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, an integrated assembly <b>51</b> of outer and inner connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> is rotatably mounted on the frame end portion <b>42</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Each outer connecting mechanism <b>52</b> includes an outer roller structure <b>55</b>, and each inner connecting mechanism <b>54</b> includes an inner roller structure <b>56</b>, roller structures <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> each being adapted to receive the looped end portion <b>39</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of a respective one of the circumferential straps <b>14</b>. As more fully described below, the integrated assembly <b>51</b> of outer and inner roller structures <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> is rotatably supported by lugs <b>58</b> projecting outwardly from frame end portion <b>42</b> and rotatable about axis <b>59</b>. Thus, the inner and outer connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, <b>52</b> are mounted on the adjacent second end portion <b>42</b> of the frame <b>38</b>, the respective outer connecting mechanisms <b>52</b> being positioned between adjacent pairs of inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, wherein the connecting mechanisms arrayed alongside window frame end portion <b>40</b> alternate between interleaved, outer and inner connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. In the present embodiment, the outer connecting mechanisms <b>52</b> project outwardly from the adjacent edge portion <b>42</b> of frame <b>38</b> beyond the adjacent inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, the inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b> being spaced inwardly from, and positioned between, the adjacent outer connecting mechanisms <b>52</b> and the panel end portion <b>42</b>, thereby forming the staggered array <b>60</b> of connecting mechanisms extending along the frame end portion <b>42</b>. A similar, staggered array of connecting mechanisms is mounted on the frame first end portion <b>40</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 5</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">The construction and functions of the two types of connecting mechanisms, that is, outer connecting mechanisms <b>52</b> and inner, contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>54</b> will be more fully understood from the description to follow, particularly those sections including reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-15</figref>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>19</b>. It should be noted initially that the connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, arrayed in staggered array <b>60</b>, are particularly adapted to receive the end portions of circumferential straps <b>14</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, for reasons to be discussed more fully hereinbelow. As previously noted, in modules such as that of the present embodiment, the tensile forces sustained by the respective circumferential straps <b>14</b> are usually greater than those sustained by the longitudinal straps <b>16</b>, and, for reasons that will become apparent from the description to follow, the staggered arrays <b>60</b> of connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are particularly suited for receiving and distributing such circumferential loads.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, it will be seen that, in the present embodiment, the connecting means mounted on the frame side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are of a configuration differing from that of those just described, mounted on the end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. With primary reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a plurality of contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>62</b> are mounted on side edge portion <b>46</b> of frame <b>38</b>, the contiguous connecting mechanisms being mutually spaced along the frame side edge portion <b>46</b> in a linear, non-staggered, contiguous array <b>64</b>. Thus, the contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>62</b> are contiguous with the side edge portion <b>46</b> of the frame <b>38</b>. Each contiguous connecting mechanism <b>62</b> includes a roller <b>66</b>, the rollers <b>66</b> being rotatable about their axes, which are spaced outwardly from and aligned generally parallel to the side portion <b>46</b> of the frame <b>38</b>. In the present embodiment, the rollers <b>66</b> of the contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>62</b> are thus coaxially aligned, positioned in mutually spaced, side-by-side array along the frame side portion <b>46</b>, and rotatable about a common axis extending generally parallel to the frame side portion <b>46</b>. The construction of connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>62</b> will be described in greater detail below in the sections referencing <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-18</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">With additional reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first window frame <b>38</b> is seen in an enlarged view with adjacent portions of the circumferential and longitudinal straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are shown as they would be configured when the module <b>10</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is in a non-inflated mode, e.g., during an assembly operation. In the present embodiment, they are interwoven to form a webbing, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The circumferential straps <b>14</b> thus extend perpendicularly outwardly, in mutually parallel alignment, from the adjacent frame end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> to which they are connected, and the longitudinal straps <b>16</b> extend perpendicularly outwardly, in mutually parallel alignment, from the respective frame side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> to which they are respectively connected, and perpendicularly of the circumferential straps <b>14</b>. As may be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the circumferential straps <b>14</b> are in substantially contiguous, side-by-side orientation, whereas the longitudinal straps <b>16</b> are mutually spaced, a feature that provides important structural benefits, as will be understood from the description to follow.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">Preferably, additional, supplementary straps <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are provided, respectively extending alongside the side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the frame <b>38</b>, supplementary straps <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> being connected by stitching <b>67</b> to adjacent upper portions of longitudinal and circumferential straps <b>16</b>, <b>14</b> adjacent the frame <b>38</b> for maintaining straps <b>16</b>, <b>14</b> in parallel alignment and for limiting access by flexible portions of the module flexible wall to connecting mechanisms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. Supplementary straps <b>72</b> extend circumferentially, and supplementary straps <b>74</b> extend longitudinally of the module <b>10</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The structure and attachment of the supplementary straps <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> will be described in greater detail in a later section with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a diagrammatic representation is made of portions of the flexible, multi-layer outer shell or wall structure <b>68</b> of the inflatable module <b>10</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) shown in association with window frame assembly <b>26</b> and window frame <b>38</b>. The construction of such flexible multi-layer wall structures <b>68</b> and their integration into an inflatable space module is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,231,010 and 6,547,189, previously incorporated by reference. Accordingly, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is not a comprehensive representation of the construction of such a flexible wall structure <b>68</b>, but rather, a partially diagrammatic representation of portions of such a wall structure, with the window frame assembly <b>26</b>, for illustrating the relative orientation of the window frame assembly <b>26</b>, frame <b>38</b>, and adjacent layers. For example, the outer, multi-layer M/MOD structure and other components normally present in such wall structures have been omitted for clarity. In the present embodiment and as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, progressing outwardly from the innermost to the outermost layer (progressing upwardly as viewed in the drawing), an inner bladder attachment frame <b>69</b> <i>a</i>, flexible bladder <b>69</b> <i>b</i>, outer bladder attachment frame <b>69</b> <i>c</i>, and bladder protective layer <b>69</b> <i>d</i>, suitable a felt layer, are oriented beneath the frame <b>38</b> of first window frame assembly <b>26</b>. Each of the layers <b>69</b> <i>a</i>, <b>69</b> <i>b</i>, <b>69</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>69</b> <i>d </i>has a respective rectangular opening <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>formed therethrough.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">When assembled and integrated with the window frame <b>38</b>, layers <b>69</b> <i>a</i>, <b>69</b> <i>b</i>, <b>69</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>69</b> <i>d </i>and the window frame <b>38</b> are sandwiched together in mutually parallel, contiguous alignment, and the rectangular openings <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>of layers <b>69</b> <i>a</i>, <b>69</b> <i>b</i>, <b>69</b> <i>c </i>are aligned in register with each other and with the peripheral portions the window frame <b>38</b>, as will be described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b>. The restraint layer straps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are omitted from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for clarity but will be understood to extend outwardly from the frame <b>38</b> and adjacent the bladder protective layer <b>69</b> <i>d</i>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the layers <b>69</b> <i>a</i>, <b>69</b> <i>b</i>, <b>69</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>69</b> <i>d </i>are convexly curved along their lengths, i.e., convexly curved along the length of the frame <b>38</b>, to conform with the semi-cylindrical configuration of the window frame assembly <b>26</b> and frame <b>38</b>. The bladder <b>69</b> <i>b </i>is thus sandwiched between attachment frames <b>69</b> <i>a </i>and <b>69</b> <i>c </i>and sealed to the window frame <b>39</b> by suitable sealing means, such as an O-ring, not shown.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The construction of the present embodiment of the window frame <b>38</b> and connecting means <b>50</b>, including connecting mechanism arrays <b>60</b> and <b>64</b>, will now be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-15</figref>. With initial reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the frame <b>38</b> and associated components are shown as viewed from outside the module <b>10</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), i.e., looking inwardly. For clarity, portions of the straps are omitted for clarity. For example, those adjacent three of the four corners of frame <b>38</b>, and supplementary straps <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are omitted. As summarized above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, circumferential straps <b>14</b> are connected to the end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the window frame <b>38</b> by outer connecting mechanisms <b>52</b> and inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b> (seen most clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) mounted on frame end portions <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> and forming staggered arrays <b>60</b> of connecting mechanisms extending along the lengths of end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. As also seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, longitudinal straps <b>16</b> are connected to the side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the window frame <b>38</b> by the mutually aligned, contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>62</b> mounted on the respective window frame side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. As may be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the longitudinal straps <b>16</b> engaged with and supported by respective inner or contiguous connecting mechanism <b>54</b> are mutually parallel and laterally spaced from one another, as indicated at gap <b>70</b>, whereas the circumferential straps <b>14</b>, also mutually parallel, are preferably in side-by-side, substantially contiguous array.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, whereas, as previously noted, the window frame <b>38</b> is of convex curvature in side elevation matching the cylindrical curvature of the restraint layer body portion <b>17</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the oval window seat <b>48</b> need not be configured to correspond with the configuration of the restraint layer and is thus rectangular in side elevation. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the outer surface <b>49</b> <i>a </i>of frame <b>38</b> is convex, along the length of frame <b>38</b>. The inner surface <b>49</b> <i>b </i>is concave and continues the curvature of circumferentially extending straps <b>14</b>. Loops <b>39</b> are formed in the ends of the respective circumferential and longitudinal straps <b>14</b>, <b>18</b> at their juncture with the frame <b>38</b> for facilitating connection of the straps to the frame and also extend along the circumferential path. As disclosed in the referenced &#39;010 and &#39;189 patents, the use of such looped end portions <b>39</b> associated with respective rollers prevents binding or the like at the connection of the respective straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> with the frame <b>38</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">An embodiment of the integrated assembly <b>51</b> of connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> will now be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and to sectional views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is also referenced with respect to the rotatable, integrated assembly <b>51</b> and the staggered array <b>60</b> of connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Referring now primarily to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an enlarged, fragmentary plan view of the corner section of the frame <b>38</b>, indicated by broken line VII in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, includes details of the connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> (<b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and their relationship to the frame <b>38</b>. The region shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is thus a portion of the upper left corner of window frame <b>36</b> as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, circumferential straps <b>14</b> are connected to outer connecting mechanism <b>52</b> and first and second inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b</i>. Outer connecting mechanism <b>52</b> is thus interleaved, or interposed, between the inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>and projects outwardly from the frame end portion <b>40</b> beyond the inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b</i>. Each of the connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> <i>a</i>, and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>are thus mounted on the first end portion <b>40</b> of the window frame <b>38</b>, as seen more clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, first and second, inner connecting mechanisms <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>include first and second roller structures <b>56</b> <i>a</i>, and <b>56</b> <i>b</i>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, roller structures <b>56</b> are bifurcated, having mutually spaced clevises formed on opposite end portions thereof and extending outwardly therefrom, as will be described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Pins <b>80</b> <i>a </i>and <b>80</b> <i>b </i>extend coaxially through respective roller structures <b>56</b> <i>a </i>and <b>56</b> <i>b</i>, pin <b>80</b> <i>a </i>being rotatably supported within corresponding bores formed through lugs <b>58</b> <i>a </i>and <b>58</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>), and pin <b>80</b> <i>b </i>is rotatably supported within corresponding bores formed through lugs <b>58</b> <i>c </i>and <b>58</b> <i>d</i>. Suitable locking keys <b>82</b> or the like extend laterally through pins <b>80</b> <i>a </i>and <b>80</b> <i>b </i>for securing pin <b>80</b> <i>a </i>engagement with lugs <b>58</b> <i>a </i>and <b>58</b> <i>b</i>, and for securing pin <b>80</b> <i>b </i>in lugs <b>58</b> <i>c</i>, <b>58</b> <i>d</i>.

    <p num="p-0073">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the window frame assembly <b>26</b> is represented as being viewed from a position inside the inflatable module <b>10</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), as previously noted, in contrast with the previous figures.

    <p num="p-0075">As seen in both <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, and <b>18</b>, the frame end portion <b>40</b> and associated inner and outer connecting mechanisms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> extend laterally outwardly from the frame <b>38</b> and are also canted inwardly, or downwardly as viewed in the drawing, following the circumferential curvature of the module <b>10</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), thereby avoiding any substantial discontinuity or deviation from the cylindrical contour of the module elongated body <b>17</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref>, one of the circumferential straps <b>14</b>, terminating in one of loops <b>39</b>, is seen extending outwardly from the frame <b>38</b> and connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, <b>52</b> and extending along the cylindrical contour of the frame <b>38</b>, as seen more clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It thus continues the inwardly curved contour of the module outer wall structure and the frame <b>38</b>. The portion of the circumferential strap <b>14</b> seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref> constitutes one of the looped end portions <b>39</b>. Several of the longitudinal straps <b>16</b>, shown in cross-section in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref>, are interwoven with the circumferential straps <b>14</b>. Additionally, several of the longitudinally extending supplementary straps <b>74</b> are seen as interwoven with the upper portion of loop <b>39</b>, stitched thereto as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for keeping straps <b>14</b> and attached loops <b>39</b> in alignment, and for isolating connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> from flexible layers, not shown, of wall structure <b>12</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The flexible bladder <b>69</b> <i>b </i>is positioned inwardly (below, as viewed in the drawing) of the restraint layer webbing formed by straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and is sealingly connected to the inner surface of frame end portion <b>40</b>, as will now be described. Starting from the frame <b>38</b> and progressing inwardly (downwardly as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref>), outer bladder attachment frame <b>69</b> <i>c</i>, bladder <b>69</b> <i>b</i>, and inner bladder attachment frame <b>69</b> <i>a </i>are sandwiched together and maintained in sealing relation to the inner surface of frame <b>38</b> by suitable fastening means <b>100</b>, the inner bladder connecting frame <b>69</b> <i>a </i>and fastening means <b>100</b> being shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. A layer <b>69</b> <i>d</i>, suitably of a relatively stiff felt material, is fastened over the bladder <b>69</b> <i>b </i>adjacent the connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, <b>52</b> for protecting the bladder from possible protrusion into gaps formed between the connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, one of the longitudinal straps <b>16</b>, terminating in one of the loops <b>39</b>, is seen extending laterally or outwardly from the frame side portion <b>44</b>, and several longitudinal straps <b>14</b>, interwoven with the longitudinal straps, are seen in cross-section. In contrast to the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref>, the longitudinal strap <b>16</b>, associated connecting mechanism <b>62</b>, and frame side portion <b>44</b> are not inwardly canted, but rather, extend linearly outwardly from the frame side portion <b>44</b> along a common plane, thereby avoiding substantial discontinuities between the roller mechanisms <b>62</b>, the straps <b>16</b>, and the side portion <b>44</b> of the module body <b>17</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). That is, the straps <b>16</b> and frame <b>38</b> extend substantially linearly along the frame inner surface, or parallel to the wall structure of module <b>10</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the longitudinal direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The inner and outer connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, <b>52</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref> were described with reference to FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>5</b>-<b>10</b>. Inner, bifurcated roller structure <b>56</b> of inner connecting mechanism <b>54</b> is rotatably mounted on frame end portion <b>40</b>. Outer roller <b>55</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), of outer connecting mechanism <b>52</b>, is axially rotatable with pin <b>81</b>, which is rotatably mounted in clevis <b>84</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B</figref>, <b>18</b>) formed integrally with bifurcated inner roller structure <b>56</b>. As seen most clearly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, clevis <b>84</b> rotatably supports pin <b>81</b> and outer roller <b>55</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). The circumferential strap <b>14</b> seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is looped around the inner curved surface of inner roller structure <b>56</b>, whereas in the section shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a circumferential strap <b>14</b> is shown looped around the outer roller <b>55</b>, a second circumferential strap, shown in broken lines, being seen behind strap <b>14</b> as viewed in the drawing, looped around inner roller structure <b>56</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">With respect to the contiguous connecting mechanism <b>62</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, roller <b>66</b> is seen supporting the looped end portion <b>39</b> of longitudinal strap <b>16</b>, roller <b>66</b> and shaft <b>88</b> being rotatably supported by clevis <b>86</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">As also seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the clevis <b>86</b>, roller <b>66</b>, and longitudinal strap <b>16</b> are each supported by the inwardly projecting clevis bar <b>92</b>. Accordingly, and as will be understood by those in the art, in structures other those of the present embodiment, non-axial forces could, in some circumstances, be applied to structures such as the bar <b>92</b>. That is, although after inflation of the module, tensional forces on the straps <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and those applied by the straps to the clevis bar <b>92</b> are normally axial, exerted along the length of the straps and the length of the bar <b>92</b>, in circumstances such as those experienced during the inflation process in which the module flexible wall structure is unfolded and expanded, non-axial forces may be applied, and the bar could thus act as a lever, multiplying such forces, with potentially deleterious effects on the clevis or window frame <b>38</b>. In contrast, the integrated, staggered, dual roller assembly <b>51</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref> does not entail such potentially deleterious effects because the entire, integrated roller assembly <b>51</b> is rotatable in either rotational direction, and because no elongated bar structure, such as <b>92</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, is employed. Accordingly for applications in which greater tensional forces may be present, the staggered connecting means array <b>60</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), incorporating integrated roller assembly <b>51</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</figref>) can be advantageous.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The above-discussed arrangements for connecting the straps, connecting mechanisms, bladder, and protective felt layer thus provide a smooth transition of the restraint layer <b>12</b> and bladder <b>69</b> <i>b </i>into the frame <b>38</b>. With respect to the straps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> that are connected to the frame <b>38</b>, the supplemental straps <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> crossing them are woven on one of the adjacent loops <b>39</b> of the straps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, securing the straps adjacent the frame <b>38</b>. The felt buffer <b>69</b> <i>b </i>provides a smooth backing near the frame-bladder interface covering any gaps that may exist near the interface to prohibit the bladder from bulging through these gaps. The felt buffer also serves to position the straps that pass under the rigid frame, as they are indexed to it.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the window frame <b>38</b> is seen having a second embodiment of staggered connecting means <b>160</b>. The second embodiment of staggered connecting means <b>160</b> differs from the embodiment <b>60</b> seen, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in that it does not include a rotatable, integrated assembly <b>51</b> of connecting mechanisms, such as that seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and related figures. Instead, in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the staggered array of connecting means <b>160</b> incorporate inner, contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>154</b> and outer connecting mechanisms <b>152</b>, each of which are individually mounted on frame end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> by devises supported on outwardly extending elongated shafts <b>192</b>. Accordingly the construction of the connecting mechanisms <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> of the second embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> will be seen as similar to that previously described with respect to the contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>62</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, which also are mounted on side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the frame <b>38</b> as in the previously described embodiment. The connecting mechanisms <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> each include a respective roller <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>, each of the rollers <b>158</b> of inner connecting mechanisms <b>154</b> being axially aligned, and each of the outer rollers <b>156</b>, of outer connecting mechanisms <b>152</b>, being axially aligned along an axis spaced outwardly from the frame <b>38</b> and the inner, contiguous connecting mechanisms <b>154</b>. Thus, as in the first embodiment incorporating integrated assembly <b>51</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> includes inner and outer connecting mechanisms (<b>154</b> and <b>152</b>) mounted on the frame structure <b>38</b> and spaced along the structure peripheral end portions in an interleafed array in which respective outer connecting mechanisms <b>152</b> are interposed between adjacent pairs of inner connecting mechanisms <b>154</b>, the outer connecting mechanisms projecting outwardly from the peripheral edge portion of the frame structure beyond the adjacent inner connecting mechanisms <b>154</b> and thereby forming a staggered array of connecting mechanisms extending along the panel structure end portions.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Thus, the present invention provides an improved means for integrating rigid structures into the flexible wall structure of an inflatable structure and providing an efficient and relatively low-stress interface between the rigid and non-rigid components. Issues of particular concern with respect to the construction of such modules and their safety and reliability over time, including problems relating to the integration and interaction of the rigid and flexible components, are substantially alleviated by the disclosed structures. Such constructional issues include the necessity of preventing damage to the flexible layers incorporated in the flexible shell of such modules, such as the bladder, restraint layer, and protective backing materials, as the module is unfolded and expanded during its inflation and deployment. Also, the structure of the present invention accommodates the differential stresses and differing reaction to stresses by rigid and flexible components experienced during and after deployment, as the flexible outer shell is expanded.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">As disclosed, means are provided for reducing potentially damaging, differential stresses on the respective flexible straps, for ensuring that such forces are evenly distributed, and for accommodating the differing reactions to stress of the rigid and flexible components. For example, such differential stresses are accommodated by the use of connecting mechanisms particularly adapted for connecting the mutually parallel circumferential and mutually parallel longitudinal webbing straps to one or more rigid panel members, such as window frames, such that tensional loads are equally distributed thereon; such that the loads are parallel to the major axes of the panel; and such that bending moments on elements on the panel are reduced. Non-axial stress on the connecting mechanisms, such as the lever effect that could be associated with elongated members supporting roller-bearing devises as previously discussed, are reduced, particularly with respect to the first embodiment incorporating a rotatable, integrated assembly.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">With respect to the need to accommodate and equally distribute the loads, it has been noted that, upon inflation, the flexible components of the module <b>10</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), such as restraint layer <b>12</b>, tend to stretch or elongate when they sustain tensional loads, whereas rigid elements, such as frame structure <b>38</b>, do not flex or elongate to any significant degree. The elongation of the flexible and rigid structures may be sufficiently different that an uneven load distribution could result around a respective window frame. As previously noted, if unaddressed, this local effect could overload the restraint layer <b>12</b> and/or frame in that region, for example, overloading the strips connected to portions of the frame, and placing undesired strain on the frame itself. Accordingly, the straps connected to the rigid frame may be oversized by an amount sufficient to accommodate the substantial lack of elongation over the length or width of the frame. This may be accomplished empirically by noting the elongation per unit length along the longitudinal and circumferential straps <b>16</b>, <b>14</b> as they are subjected to the tension experienced during the inflation process and during subsequent use over time, and lengthening the straps connected to the frame <b>38</b> by an equivalent amount. It should be further noted that, since the circumferential and longitudinal straps may be under different degrees of strain, the compensating elongation of each may be different. It should also be noted that, because of the above-discussed advantages provided by the staggered array of connecting means comprising inner and outer connecting mechanisms, for example, the ability to accommodate greater numbers of circumferential straps per unit of length along the frame end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and with the staggered array of connecting means, the rotation of the integrated assembly <b>51</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) of inner and outer connecting mechanisms <b>54</b>, <b>52</b> is effective to follow the contour of the straps and reduce lateral strain. Thus, the difficulties of accommodating the differential elongation of rigid and non-rigid components are reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">As will now be understood, the circumferential straps <b>14</b> may be positioned in mutually adjacent, mutually contiguous alignment rather than mutually spaced alignment because the staggered array <b>60</b> of connecting mechanisms <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and, in the second embodiment, the staggered array <b>160</b> of connecting mechanisms <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> permit closer spacing of the straps <b>14</b>. As noted above, this is because the inner connecting mechanisms are positioned behind the outer connecting mechanisms and may therefore extend laterally on either side of the outer connecting mechanisms, permitting their respective rollers to be spaced closer together along the frame end portions <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">As discussed in previous sections, tension applied along straps extending circumferentially around the cylindrical, longitudinally extending inflatable module body is normally greater than that applied along straps extending longitudinally, along the length of the elongated body. Accordingly, in some applications, if the loads are to be evenly distributed, it is advantageous to use a greater number of circumferential straps than longitudinal straps. As will now be understood, embodiments of the present invention permit closer spacing of adjacent straps. Thus, as previously noted, the circumferential straps connected to respective end portions of the rigid panel may be substantially contiguous with one another, rather than mutually spaced. If desired, they may be positioned closer to one another than the longitudinal straps, connected to side portions of the panel. Thus, by reducing the strain sustained by respective circumferential straps, the loading of the circumferential and longitudinal straps may be substantially equalized. As will now be understood from the above description and accompanying drawings, the present invention thus substantially alleviates such problems, permitting closer spacing of the clevis/roller connecting mechanisms and the straps, as previously discussed, along the end portions of the window frame. The differential between the loads sustained by the circumferential and longitudinal load-bearing straps may therefore be substantially reduced</p>
    <p num="p-0088">Further, the connecting mechanisms of the above-described embodiments minimize the distance between inflatable and rigid components, reducing the number of unattached restraint layer straps. Further, because of the closely adjacent positioning of the restraint layer to the frame and the use of the protective felt layer, gaps at this interface, which could allow the bladder of an inflatable module to protrude with the possibility of catastrophic failure, are reduced. Overall, relatively few parts are necessary, and simplification is achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in the foregoing description and illustrated in the accompanying drawing, various improvements, modifications, and alternative applications and uses will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, although the illustrated embodiments have related to applications with a module intended for use in exoatmospheric space, the invention also has other applications such as applications in structures intended for use in marine and terrestrial environments, as previously discussed. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be considered in terms of the following claims, and it is not to be limited to the details of the embodiments and operation described in this specification and shown in the drawings.</p>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="p-0002">1. Technical Field</p>
    <p num="p-0003">This invention relates generally to an apparatus and method incorporating biofeedback training into a computer-generated multi-user virtual environment, and augmenting a computer user&#39;s sense of immersion in the computer-generated multi-user virtual environment by adding physiological interactivity to the multi-user virtual environment and by influencing the scoring of performance in the multi-user virtual environment with measured values of a user&#39;s physiological functions.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">2. Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Because of the association of certain human physiological states with the optimal performance of certain human activities and behaviors, or the attainment of superior states of health, biofeedback training directed to self-regulating such physiological states seeks to optimize the performance of their associated actions, behaviors, and states of health, thereby facilitating mastery in action and well-being. For example, a self-induced reduction of an elevated heart rate and blood pressure, typically associated with anxiety, may be expected to move a person into a state superior focus with respect to a challenge and its resolution, which state is better suited for victory over an opponent in real or simulated combat or completion of a real or simulated task.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Biofeedback training techniques for physiological self-regulation are fundamentally grounded upon repetition and the frequency of repetition, techniques for which persons have varying and limiting tolerances, particularly if their practice of biofeedback is undertaken in an environment that is not motivating because it fails to engender excitement, enthusiasm, challenge, stimulation, or curiosity. The absence of such motivating feelings often results in noncompliance with biofeedback training—a persistent and pervasive problem that has limited the effectiveness of biofeedback training incorporated into videogames and computer simulations to date.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Biofeedback training programmed into videogames or computer simulations has been limited to single-user videogames or single-user computer simulations, wherein the user is made aware of only some of his or her own monitored physiological functions, and the user&#39;s interaction with the videogame or computer simulation is modulated only by the control of his or her own physiological functions. In effect, the user competes only with himself or herself, and this has been found to limit commitment to play and participation, with a concomitant decline in biofeedback-mediated self-regulation of the user&#39;s physiological state.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The present invention makes biofeedback training more inherently self-motivating by incorporating biofeedback training into a computer-generated multi-user virtual environment (“MUVE”) and augmenting the computer-generated audio and video interfaces that create the sensation of immersion in a MUVE with a physiological user interface that enhances the users&#39; sense of immersion in the MUVE by:</p>
    <p num="h-0002">[i] physiologically modulating the physical control inputs used by each of the players in the multi-user videogame or each of the participants in the multi-user computer-simulated task; and,</p>
    <p num="p-0009">[ii] incorporating measured values of physiological functions of each of the players in the multi-user videogame or each of the participants in the multi-user computer-simulated task into the score by which performance in the multi-user videogame or multi-user computer-simulated task is graded; and,
<br/>
[iii] subject to rules governing participation in the multi-user videogame or the multi-user computer-simulated task, making the performance scores and a physiological performance profile of each player or participant visible or invisible on the output devices of other players or participants, thereby creating physiologically competitive and cooperative incentives in the multi-user videogame and the multi-user computer-simulated task.
</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="p-0010">The invention is a system and method for incorporating biofeedback training into a computer-generated MUVE, having a first exemplary embodiment as a multi-user videogame and a second exemplary embodiment as a multi-user computer-simulated task, and enhancing each user&#39;s sense of immersion in said MUVE, with a physiological user interface that:</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="p-0021">The human autonomic nervous system is responsible for the autonomic execution and control of a number of physiological functions that are either vital to life or to the normal performance of a bodily function or to the normal performance of organ systems supportive of life. Some common examples of human physiological functions include, respiration, digestion, circulation, excretion, sight, and hearing.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">In general, human physiological functions may be associated with one or more biomechanical effects, such as for example, a palpable pulse or the diastolic or systolic blood pressure, measured, for example, by a sphygmomanometer. Human physiological functions may also be associated with a bioelectrical signal, such as, for example, the time-dependent magnitude and sign of the wave of cardiac depolarization measured and drawn by an electrocardiogram (“ECG”).</p>
    <p num="p-0023">Accordingly, biomechanical effects or bioelectrical signals associated with human physiological functions produce physiological parameters or physiological parametric functions, having measurable values that are well known in the medical arts.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">For example, the human physiological function of respiration is characterized, inter alia, by such physiological parameters as the respiratory rate (“RR”) in respirations per minute, tidal volume, end-expiratory pressure, and other physiological parameters. Respiratory function may be further characterized by another physiological parameter called the “percent sat” or “O<sub>2 </sub>sat,” that is indicative of the percentage of red blood cell-borne hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen, as measured by a pulse oximeter placed on a digit of a person.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">Other examples of physiological parameters include, but are not limited to, skin temperature (“ST”), body temperature (“BT”), intraocular pressure (“IOP”), intracranial pressure (“ICP”), the galvanic skin response (“GSR”), and pupillary dilation.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">As indicated hereinabove, measurements of biomechanical effects or bioelectrical signals associated with human physiological functions also produce correlative time-dependent physiological parametric functions that are also well known in the medical arts.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">Circulation is an example of a human physiological function that is characterized, inter alia, by both physiological parameters and physiological parametric functions. Among the physiological parametric functions descriptive of circulation is the time-dependent electrocardiogram (“ECG”) waveform of depolarization and repolarization occurring during a cycle of cardiac contraction and relaxation, that is characterized by such features as its P wave, QRS complex, T wave, ST segment. Examples of other physiological parametric functions correlated with human physiological functions include, the electroencephalogram (“EEG”), the electromyogram (“EMG”), and the visually-evoked potential (“VEP”).</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Circulation is further characterized by such physiological parameters as the heart rate (“HR”), measured in beats per minute, and the blood pressure (“BP”), recorded as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (“mm Hg”), to the diastolic blood pressure, also measured in mm Hg.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Prevailing medical usage departs from the technical distinction, made in the foregoing discussion, between a physiological function and the physiological parameters or physiological parametric functions representative of that physiological function. Accordingly as used hereinafter the terms “measured value of a physiological function” or “measured value” shall mean the magnitude of a human physiological parameter or the magnitude of a physiological parametric function representative of a quantitative aspect of any human physiological function, including central nervous system electroencephalographic activity and muscular electromyographic activity.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">Certain combinations of, or changes in, the measured values of physiologic functions may be used as signs or indices of emotional or behavioral states, in addition to serving as signs of medical states. For example, tachycardia, an increase in a participant&#39;s HR, may be used as an index generally associated with the degree of fear a person is experiencing. Tachycardia accompanied by tachypnea, i.e., shortness of breath, an elevation in the BP and a decrease in O<sub>2 </sub>sat may accompany the experience of frank panic. On the other hand, a low, regular and rhythmic HR may correspond to a state of relatively greater equanimity, calm, or relaxation.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">As a further example, a sharp increase in a subject&#39;s RR, i.e., hyperventilation, may be used not only as a measure of change in respiratory performance, but also as an index that is reflective of an emotional state such as, for example, fear or anxiety. A modest increase in a subject&#39;s RR may be used as an index reflective of the experience of stress. A modest lowering in RR may correspond to a state of relatively greater equanimity, or relaxation; whereas, a sharp decrease in RR, or hypoventilation, may correspond to a state of obtundation. Tachypnea, indicative of a rapid rate of breathing with little air exchange, akin to gasping, may also indicate respiratory dysfunction or a state of heightened anxiety that could, for example, interfere with a mission-critical task or behavior.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Similarly, an increase in body temperature, measured, for example, by a thermometer disposed in the outer canal of the ear, or an increase in the degree of perspiration, as measured by the GSR, are indices of a change in those physiologic functions that are generally associated with anxiety or stress.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">The normal magnitudes or normal ranges of magnitudes of human physiological functions have been compiled and correlated with states of health or states of performance. For example, a resting HR of 60 beats per minute (bpm) is generally associated with healthy cardiac function. Deviations from the normal magnitudes or normal ranges of magnitudes of human physiological functions have been interpreted as medical signs of inferior health, disease, dysfunction or impairment. For example, a resting HR of 40 bpm is a sign of a bradycardia that may be the result of inferior health, disease, dysfunction or impairment of cardiac function.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">By accrual over many years, there exists a vast compilation of measured values of physiological functions that have been normalized with respect to such exemplary variables as age, gender, weight, and occasionally race. This compilation has, for the most part, been organized into a taxonomy, well known in the medical arts, that associates measured values of physiological functions and combinations thereof with physiological states, ranging from excellent health to disease, dysfunction or impairment. This compilation of measured values of physiological functions and its associated taxonomic organization with physiological states of health and disease is available in whole or in part through various sources and repositories such as books, journals, databases, websites and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">It is also well known to those with ordinary skill in the medical, psychological, physiological, coaching and biofeedback arts that, in general, certain states of physiology, characterized by certain measured values of physiological functions, accompany, support and sustain certain states of mind such as, for example, anger, fear, concentration, equanimity, confidence; and, that, in general, certain states of physiology, characterized by certain measured values of physiological functions, accompany, support and sustain certain states of performance, such as, for example, peak performance. Contrariwise, the presence of yet other states of physiology characterized by yet other measured values of physiological functions efface or militate against the attainment of certain states of mind or performance. For example, the tachycardia, tachypnea and hypertension associated with a state of panic militate against either a state of focused concentration or a state of peak athletic performance.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">As indicated hereinabove, biofeedback generally refers to an area of psychophysiological research and technologies by which a subject is trained to exert conscious control over certain unconscious physiological functions, generally controlled by the autonomic nervous system, such as, for example, the BP, HR and RR. The measured values of physiological functions may be received as inputs from a variety of biosensory devices and then displayed on an output device, i.e., “fed back,” to the subject so that the subject is able to monitor them and to learn to consciously control the physiological functions they represent.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Accordingly, biofeedback techniques are used to consciously move a person&#39;s physiological functions from abnormal values to normal values; and, are also used to consciously make human physiological functions consonant with a desired state of mind or state of performance, whether such consonance entails altering a physiological state to make it consistent with the experience of a desired state of mind or state of performance, or, entails effacing a physiological state that is inconsistent with the experience of a desired state of mind or state of performance.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">As used herein, the term “multi-user virtual environment” (“MUVE”) refers to a software-generated and hardware-manifested virtual environment, in which the senses of a plurality of users are simultaneously engaged and stimulated by output devices, described hereinafter, which output devices create the perception by each user of an immersion in an environment in which objects exist and events transpire; and, in which each user participates to interact with objects and to influence events, typically by means of at least one manipulatable representation of the user appearing in the MUVE. The software generating the MUVE also responds to input from input devices operated by each user, described hereinafter, which input controls the actions and behavior of each user&#39;s representation.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">As used herein, the term “user” or “participant” refers, without limitation, to an exemplary computer user among a plurality of users interacting with a MUVE, for example, by playing a multi-user videogame or participating in a multi-user computer-simulated task, either of which may be established over a network, or be established by a non-networked, stand-alone computer.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">As used herein, the term “physiologic state” refers to the physiological performance of a human being defined by a set of at least one measured value of a physiological function. A normal physiological state obtains if all of the measured values of physiological functions indicating or defining the physiological state are within a predefined degree of statistical variability (e.g., standard deviation) from a statistical measure of central tendency (e.g., mean) of a normal population of individuals. An abnormal physiological state obtains if any one of the measured values of physiological functions indicating or defining the physiological state are not within a predefined degree of statistical variability from a statistical measure of central tendency of a normal population.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">A superior physiological state obtains if at least one of the measured values of physiological functions defining a normal physiological state under a defined set of circumstances, has a supranormal value, or undergoes a supranormal change, or undergoes a supranormal rate of change, while all the remaining measured values of physiological functions that define the normal physiological state remain within a predefined degree of statistical variability from a statistical measure of central tendency of a normal population. For example, a superior physiological state would obtain if the RR of a jogger did not rise as rapidly as expected for a given acceleration of the pace at which the jogger runs, based upon RR statistics from a normal population.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Contrariwise, an inferior physiologic state obtains if at least one measured value of a physiological function of a set of measured values of physiological functions defining a normal physiological state under a defined set of circumstances, has an infranormal value, or undergoes an infranormal change or undergoes an infranormal rate of change, while all the remaining measured values of physiological functions that define the normal physiological state remain within a predefined degree of statistical variability from a statistical measure of central tendency of a normal population. For example, an inferior physiological state would obtain if the RR of a jogger rose more rapidly than expected for a given acceleration of the pace at which the jogger runs, based upon RR statistics from a normal population.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">The use of the descriptor “supranormal” with respect to a measured value of a physiological function that is associated with superior physiological state is intended to reflect the fact that a superior physiological function may be associated with a measured value thereof that either increases in value, decreases in value, or undergoes no change in value. Similarly, the use of the descriptor “infranormal” with respect to a measured value of a physiological function associated with an inferior physiological state is intended to reflect the fact that inferior physiological function may also be associated with a measured value thereof that either increases in value, decreases in value, or undergoes no change in value. Consequently, any score that compiles winning or losing points based on the relative physiological supremacy or inferiority of multiple users participating in a MUVE is given user-specific, task-specific and event-specific criteria for making determinations of physiological supremacy or inferiority among those multiple users participating in the MUVE.</p>

[ii] Comparator program <b>413</b> is further programmed to receive as input from biosensory device <b>404</b> a first periodically measured value of a physiological function corresponding to a first time and a second periodically measured value of a physiological function corresponding to a second time, and to compute an measured average rate of change in value as the algebraic difference between the first periodically measured value and said second periodically measured value of the physiological function divided by the difference between the first time and the second time.
<br/>
[iii] Comparator program <b>413</b> is further programmed to receive as input from biosensory device <b>404</b> a continuously measured value of a physiological function and to compute a measured rate of change in value as the derivative with respect to time of the continuously measured value of the physiological function.

Where normal values extend across ranges having upper and lower limits, they may be assigned a mean or average value for the normative range. Normal values are defined for populations of users.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">Target values of human physiological functions (“target values”) are desirable values of human physiological functions representing a goal required of a user or group of users. Target values may be artificially defined or defined on the basis of a baselining procedure for an individual competitor. That is, an individual&#39;s physiological performance during a game can be referenced to that individual&#39;s baseline physiological performance. In this instance, physiological measures are sampled while each individual competitor participates in a game-playing session during a baseline period of interaction in the MUVE when no influence based upon physiological signals is being applied. Baseline performance statistics of central tendency (e.g., mean) and of variability (e.g., standard deviation) are then computed. An individual&#39;s physiological performance baseline may be recalibrated at selected points during the participant&#39;s game-playing career. Associated with normal values, characterized by measures of central tendency such as population means, and target values, characterized by measures of central tendency such as individuals&#39; baseline means or artificially defined values, are measures of variability such as standard deviations for populations or for an individual or artificially defined. A target physiological state obtains if all of the measured values of physiological functions indicating or defining the physiological state are within a predefined degree of statistical variability (e.g., standard deviation) from a statistical measure of central tendency (e.g., mean) from target values. An other than target physiological state obtains if any one of the measured values of physiological functions indicating or defining the physiological state are not within a predefined degree of statistical variability from a statistical measure of central tendency from target values.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Superior and inferior physiological states may be defined relative to target physiological states in the same way that superior and inferior physiological states are defined relative to normal physiological states.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">A superior physiological state obtains if at least one of the measured values of physiological functions defining a target physiological state under a defined set of circumstances, has a supratarget value, or undergoes a supratarget change, or undergoes a supratarget rate of change, while all the remaining measured values of physiological functions that define the normal physiological state remain within a predefined degree of statistical variability from a statistical measure of central tendency for populations or for an individual or artificially defined. For example, a superior physiological state would obtain if the RR of a jogger did not rise as rapidly as expected for a given acceleration of the pace at which the jogger runs, based upon the jogger&#39;s baseline statistics.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">Contrariwise, an inferior physiologic state obtains if at least one measured value of a physiological function of a set of measured values of physiological functions defining a target physiological state under a defined set of circumstances, has an infratarget value, or undergoes an infratarget change or undergoes an infratarget rate of change, while all the remaining measured values of physiological functions that define the normal physiological state remain within a predefined degree of statistical variability from a statistical measure of central tendency for populations or for an individual or artificially defined. For example, an inferior physiological state would obtain if the RR of a jogger failed to rise as rapidly as expected for a given acceleration of the pace at which the jogger runs, based upon the jogger&#39;s baseline statistics.</p>

    <p num="p-0111">Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, physiological interface software <b>410</b> may be programmed to determine the success of one user relative to another user, or to determine the success of teams of users relative other teams of users, or to determine which user or teams of users qualify for access to another hierarchical level of MUVE <b>800</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">Physiological interface software <b>410</b> may also be programmed such that performance points may be combined or exchanged among users. For example, upon attaining a pre-defined threshold score a user may choose to aid one or more a physiologically weaker allies, and may donate performance points from his score to the score of other users interacting with MUVE <b>800</b>, thereby decreasing his score by the number of performance points so donated. Alternatively, upon attaining a pre-defined threshold score, a user may choose to weaken one or more adversaries, and may withdraw performance points from the score of other users interacting with MUVE <b>800</b>, thereby augmenting his user&#39;s score by the number of performance points so withdrawn.</p>

Advanced mode display of physiological data display window <b>414</b> effectively blinds other users participating in the MUVE <b>800</b> from exemplary user A&#39;s own score and physiological performance profile, while making all other user&#39;s scores and physiological performance profiles visible to exemplary user A.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">In the “expert” mode of display, physiological data display window <b>414</b>, appears on output devices <b>403</b> of exemplary user A, wherein it displays first frame <b>418</b> and second frame <b>419</b> of exemplary user A and first frame <b>418</b> and second frame <b>419</b> of every other user participating in the MUVE <b>800</b>.

    <p num="p-0117">The competitive advantage offered to a user, such as exemplary user A, by access to the “advanced” mode or the “expert” mode of display of physiological data display window <b>414</b>, may be earned, for example, by the attainment of a threshold score or by the attainment of a predetermined physiologic performance benchmark set by either comparator program <b>413</b> or by A, or by consensus among the users participating in the MUVE <b>800</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">At any time during session in MUVE <b>800</b>, a user, such as exemplary user A, may save an earned “advanced” or “expert” mode of display of physiological data display window <b>414</b>, and revert to the default mode of display of physiological data display window <b>414</b>. Entering a code can later retrieve the earned “advanced” or “expert” modes of display.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">For any user, such as exemplary user A, the set formed by the combination of: the difference-from-normal values, difference-from-target values and standardized values computed by comparator program <b>413</b>, and recorded to physiological performance record <b>415</b> comprises a physiological performance profile of the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The physiological performance record <b>415</b> accrued in the course of a session in MUVE <b>800</b> by exemplary user A can subsequently be accessed by physiological interface software <b>410</b> or another user. For example, the physiological performance record <b>415</b> of exemplary user A in the course of a session in MUVE <b>800</b> may subsequently be assigned to another “assignee” avatar whose behavior in MUVE <b>800</b> is thereafter determined and controlled by physiological interface software <b>410</b> utilizing exemplary user A&#39;s performance record <b>415</b>, and A&#39;s avatar may be activated while exemplary user A is not participating in MUVE <b>800</b>. The assignee avatar assumes the recorded physiological performance of exemplary user A, and emulates exemplary user A&#39;s recorded physiological reactions to certain events occurring in MUVE <b>800</b>, such as parrying a sword thrust, thereby, effectively serving as a “ghost” of exemplary user A with which other users of the MUVE may interact in the absence of exemplary user A&#39;s actual participation in MUVE <b>800</b>.</p>
